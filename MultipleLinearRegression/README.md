# Multiple Linear Regression

This project contains a Jupyter Notebook demonstrating how to perform multiple linear regression on an economic index dataset using Python’s data science stack.

## Notebook

- **MultipleLinearRegression.ipynb**  
  A step-by-step walkthrough covering data loading, preprocessing, exploratory analysis, model training, evaluation, and interpretation.

## Dataset

Place the file `economic_index.csv` in the same directory as the notebook. The notebook assumes this CSV has at least:

- **`year`**, **`month`** columns (which are dropped during preprocessing)  
- Several numeric columns representing economic indicators (features)  
- One numeric target column (the last column in the dataset)

## Requirements

- Python 3.6 or higher  
- pandas  
- numpy  
- matplotlib  
- seaborn  
- scikit‑learn  
- statsmodels
