# Ridge and Lasso Regression on Algerian Forest Fires


---

## ðŸ“– Project Overview

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook (`RidgeLassoRegression.ipynb`) demonstrating endâ€‘toâ€‘end preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and predictive modeling on the **Algerian Forest Fires** dataset. We compare the performance of:

  
- **Ridge Regression**  
- **Lasso Regression**
- **ElasticNet Regression**

to predict the burned area of forest fires based on meteorological and temporal features.
